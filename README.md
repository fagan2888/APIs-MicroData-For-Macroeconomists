# APIs-MicroData-For-Macroeconomists
Provides some examples of BEA and Census API's to pull micro data that are of use for macroeconomists. There are two examples. 

The first uses the BEAs API feature (here: http://www.bea.gov/API/). The code ''bea_api_example.py'' has several examples using the bea api. The most interesting is the pulling of the county level data (e.g. population and per-capita income). Side note: this data turns out to be far richer than I thought.

The second example uses the Census API feature (here: http://www.census.gov/developers/). The code uses the census packuge and then works through some examples pulling data at fine, detailed levels of geography.
